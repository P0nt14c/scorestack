### Dynamicbeat Example Configuration #########################################
# This configuration file explains all available configuration settings. Each
# setting is listed here with its default. If you would like to change one of
# the defaults, uncomment the setting and change the value.
#
# Please note that the defaults listed here should work fine for a default
# Scorestack small/docker instance deployed on the same host as Dynamicbeat.

# The amount of time to wait after starting a round of checks before starting
# another round. Must be a string parsable by Golang's time.ParseDuration. See
# here for more information: https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration
#round_time: 30s

# The address to the Elasticsearch endpoint of your Scorestack instance. Check
# definitions will be loaded from here, and check results will be put here.
#elasticsearch: https://localhost:9200

# The credentials to use for authentication to Elasticsearch when running
# checks with Dynamicbeat. This user must have the `dynamicbeat` role.
#username: dynamicbeat
#password: changeme

# Whether to check the validity of TLS certificates used by your Scorestack
# instance.
#verify_certs: false

### Logging ###################################################################

log:
  # Whether to include timestamps and code locations in each log line.
  #verbose: false

  # The lowest log level to print. -1 is DEBUG, 0 is INFO, 1 is WARN, etc.
  #level: 0

  # Whether to colorize the log output. By default, logs will be printed with
  # color.
  #no_color: false

### Setup #####################################################################
# The remaining settings are only used by Dynamicbeat's `setup` command and the
# subcommands of `setup`. If this Dynamicbeat deployment will only use the
# `run` command, then you can leave these settings as is.

setup:
  # The address to the Kibana endpoint of your Scorestack instance that will be
  # configured by Dynamicbeat.
  #kibana: https://localhost:9200

  # The credentials to use for authentication to Elasticsearch and Kibana when
  # running cluster setup. This user must have the `superuser` role.
  #username: elastic
  #password: changeme

# The list of all the teams that will be used during the competition.
#
# At a minimum, each team must have a name defined:
#
#   - name: team01
#
# Teams can also define overrides as key-value pairs under the `overrides`
# object:
#
#   - name: team01
#     overrides:
#       DefaultPassword: team01-Changeme
#
# If you do not wish to configure any overrides for a team, you may omit the
# `overrides` object (see the first example) or you can explicitly set it to
# an empty object:
#
#   - name: team01
#     overrides: {}
teams:
  #- name: team01
  #- name: team02
  #- name: team03
  #- name: team04
  #- name: team05
